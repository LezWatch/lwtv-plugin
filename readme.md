## LezWatch.TV Plugin

Custom plugin for LezWatch.TV

## Description

The LezWatch.TV plugin contains custom code for use with the site. Instead of having everything hardcoded into the theme, or shoved in a shared MU Plugin, it was moved to it's own plugin. This allows it to be updated outside of the theme and deploy new features as needed.

The code was written by Tracy Levesque and Mika Epstein, with assistance from [Yikes!](https://YikesInc.com)

Usage documentation can be found at [docs.lezwatchtv.com](https://docs.lezwatchtv.com)

- Uses Node to install and manage components, as well as to build final versions of Blocks.
- Uses Composer for adding project dependencies.
- Includes automated build and deploy pipelines to servers using Github actions

## Requirements

- PHP 8.1 or higher
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 16+

It's recommended to use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) on macOS or [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org) for Windows to install the project dependencies.

### Code Editor and Git Client

This repository includes a list of suggested extensions for the [Visual Studio Code editor](https://code.visualstudio.com) and Xdebug support in the `.vscode` directory.

A user-friendly Git client such as [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) or [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/mac) enables smaller commits and simplifies merge conflict resolution.

## Setup ðŸ› 

1. Clone this repository: `git clone git@github.com:lezwatch/lwtv-plugin`
2. Move into the project directory: `cd lwtv-plugin`
3. Install the project dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run an initial build: `npm run build`

## Contributing

All code must pass through the `development` branch which is kept up tp date. As such, any pull requests should be made to **development**, which will push the code automatically to our development server for testing.

1. Using the `development` branch as base, create a new branch with a descriptive name like `fixing-charts` or `fix/chartjs421` or `feature/latest-posts` . Commit your work to that branch until it's ready for full testing
2. Open [a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects/creating-a-pull-request) from your feature branch to the `development` branch.
3. If you are not a main developer, your pull request will be reviewed before it can be merged. If there are issues or changes needed, you may be asked to do so, or they may be done for you.
4. When the code passes review, it will be merged into the `development` branch and can be tested on the dev server.
5. Once the code passes tests, the `development` branch will be merged into `production` and the job is done!

To install and update:

* `$ npm install` - Install all the things.
* `$ npm update` - Updates all the things.
* `$ npm run build` - Builds all the things for production.

All commits are linted automatically on commit via eslint and phpcs, to ensure nothing breaks when we push the code.

### Libraries

JS and PHP libraries are included via NPM and Composer. WordPress plugins that have been forked are now included in the main code and managed by us to prevent breakage.

The `vendor` and `node_module` files are not synced to Github anymore (as of 2023-August) to minimize the amount of files stored on the servers, and the following libraries have their required code moved via Composer and npm's post-install process:

**NPM**
* [ChartJS](https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js/)
* [TableSorter (Mottie Fork)](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter)

**Composer**
* [ICal Parser](https://github.com/u01jmg3/ics-parser)

### Deployment

Pushes to branches are automatically deployed via Github Actions as follows:

* Development: [lezwatchtvcom.stage.site](https://lezwatchtvcom.stage.site) (password required - Ask Mika)
* Production: [lezwatchtv.com](https://lezwatchtv.com)
